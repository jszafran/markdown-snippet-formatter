# Pre-commit Markdown Snippet Formatter

This repo contains a code for a `pre-commit` library hook that parses markdown files, detects code snippets for Python & SQL and formats them with `black` and `sqlfluff` respectively.

I use it to automate snippets formatting for my blog (powered by `Hugo`).
